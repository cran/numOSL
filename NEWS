Versions of R package "numOSL"
Version 1.0
        * A total of eight functions are available for performing basic numeric analysis in OSL dating, such as: equivalent dose calculation; 
          decay curve decomposition and fast-component equivalent dose estimation; statistical age models analysis and radial plot drawing.
Version 1.1
        * The condition number of the model has been taken into consideration in decay curve fitting to help to obtain more desirable estimates.
        * The signal component a*exp(-b*x) has been modified to be a*b*exp(-b*x) in function "decompc" (but not in function "decomp") to make the model more stable to analyze noise data.
Version 1.2
        * Three functions ("mcMAM", "mcFMM", "reportSAM") that can be used to analyze statistical age models with a MCMC algorithm (Slice Sampling) are available (see the manual for more details).
Version 1.3
        * A bug in function "RadialPlotter" was fixed. 
        * Uninitialized memory used in function "calED" was fixed, function "calED" was improved through a merge with function "sgcED" (the latter was removed).
        * An optional argument called "model" was added to function "fastED".
Version 1.4
        * The optional argument "maxcomp" in function "RadialPlotter" was modified to be 6 (maxcomp=6).
        * A warning regarding possible change of value in conversion from REAL(8) to INTEGER(4) in Fortran codes was fixed.
Version 1.5
        * A bug in function "calED" was fixed.
